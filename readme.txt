# 🌟 My First Git Project

Hi! I'm Aditya 👋  
This is my **first Git project**, and I created it completely using the **command prompt**.  

I’m just starting to learn how Git and GitHub work,  
so this repository is my first step in that journey.

Right now, it only has one file — `readme.txt`,  
where I wrote my first Git message:

> "Hello Git! This is my first commit."

I’ll keep learning and adding more projects as I go 🚀

**Thank you for visiting!**
